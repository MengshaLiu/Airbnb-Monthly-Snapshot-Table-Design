## Introduction
In this project, I aim to develop a monthly snapshot data model for Airbnb listings, enabling us to track and measure monthly performance metrics such as income and occupancy. Leveraging a state-of-the-art star schema, this model organizes data into a single periodic fact table and four supporting dimension tables, providing a structured and efficient framework for performance analysis.

## About Dataset
This dataset is sourced from Airbnbâ€™s platform, with data scraped quarterly to provide a comprehensive view of listings. It includes information from four key perspectives: listing, calendar (availability), host, and neighborhood. The data dictionary about how to understanding and using the data can be found here(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWCNJcSutYqpULSQHlNyGInUvHg2BoUGoNRIGa6Szc4/edit?gid=1322284596#gid=1322284596).
